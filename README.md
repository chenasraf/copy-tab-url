## üíª Development

### Dev tools

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) - fast, disk space efficient package manager
- [esno](https://github.com/antfu/esno) - TypeScript / ESNext node runtime powered by esbuild
- [npm-run-all](https://github.com/mysticatea/npm-run-all) - Run multiple npm-scripts in parallel or
  sequential
- [web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext) - Streamlined experience for developing web
  extensions

### Start Dev Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then **load extension in browser with the `extension/` folder**.

For Firefox developers, you can run the following command instead:

```bash
pnpm start:firefox
```

`web-ext` auto reloads the extension when `extension/` files changed.

> While Vite handles HMR automatically in the most of the case,
> [Extensions Reloader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fimgfedafeadlieiabdeeaodndnlbhid)
> is still recommanded for cleaner hard reloading.

### Build

To build the extension, run

```bash
pnpm build
```

And then pack files under `extension`, you can upload `extension.crx` or `extension.xpi` to
appropriate extension store.
